# This is an example environment file for Docker Compose.
# Rename this file to .env and fill in your actual credentials.
# DO NOT commit the .env file to version control if it contains sensitive data.

# --- Backend Configuration ---

# Supabase Project URL
# Found in your Supabase project settings -> API -> Project URL
SUPABASE_URL="your_supabase_project_url_here"

# Supabase Service Role Key
# Found in your Supabase project settings -> API -> Project API keys -> service_role (secret)
# This key has admin privileges and should be kept secret.
SUPABASE_KEY="your_supabase_service_role_key_here"

# OpenWeather API Key
# Get from https://openweathermap.org/api
OPENWEATHER_API_KEY="your_openweather_api_key_here"

# --- Frontend Configuration (Build-time) ---
# The frontend's API base URL is configured at build time via a build argument in docker-compose.yml.
# VITE_API_BASE_URL is set to http://backend:8000 in docker-compose.yml's frontend service build args.
# No .env configuration is directly needed for this when using Docker Compose as configured,
# unless you were running the frontend development server outside Docker and needed to point it elsewhere.

# --- Docker Compose Specific (Optional) ---
# You can define COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME to change the default project name Docker Compose uses.
# COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME=swim_forecast_buddy

# Port for backend service (if you need to change it from 8000 in docker-compose.yml)
# BACKEND_PORT=8000
# Port for frontend service (if you need to change it from 8080 in docker-compose.yml)
# FRONTEND_PORT=8080
