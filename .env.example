# The frontend's API base URL is configured at build time via a build argument in docker-compose.yml.
# VITE_API_BASE_URL is set to http://backend:8000 in docker-compose.yml's frontend service build args.
# No .env configuration is directly needed for this when using Docker Compose as configured for this variable.

# --- Docker Compose Specific (Optional) ---
# You can define COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME to change the default project name Docker Compose uses.
# COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME=swim_forecast_buddy

# Port for backend service (if you need to change it from 8000 in docker-compose.yml)
